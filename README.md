# Task 1 :  Framing the Business Scenario

In this task i was supposed to prepare 4-4 questions that can be asked by my companie's CEO and CMO related to this project keeping in mind that these questions should be focusing on strategic, operational, and marketing insights. I have prepared these questions in the following manner: <br><br><br>


### Top 4 Questions  that can be asked by the CEO:

Q.1- Which are the top 3-4 countries that have maximum contribution in our company's highest total revenue and also the countries where our business is underperforming?

Q.2- Which are our top 10 best selling products that has maximum contribution in our total revenue along with their monthly sales numbers.

Q.3- What is the monthly trend over the last year ? Is there any specific revenue drop or seasonal drop ?

Q.4- Which customer segment is using our products the maximum and how we can keep them engaged?
<br><br><br>


### Top 4 Questions  that can be asked by the CMO:

Q.1- Which product categories of our company are most popular across countries or regions.

Q.2- What is the pattern of the customer's engagement? How frequently they engage with us to buy product and how much they usually spend?

Q.3- What are the most popular days or hours to launch campaign to attract them in more numbers?

# Task 2 :  Choosing the Right Visuals

Analyzed business requirements from the CEO and CMO perspective and selected the most effective chart type for each scenario. Used guidelines to choose visuals that clearly communicate the data story. Ensured each visualization matched the specific business question.<br><br><br>

# Task 3 : Creating Effective Visuals

Created visuals for four key questions from the CEO and CMO using Tableau or Power BI. Cleaned the data by removing negative quantities and incorrect unit prices, applying conditional formulas or data transformation methods before analysis. Each visual was placed on a separate tab labeled by question number, covering:<br><br>

- CEO: Monthly revenue trends for 2011 to analyze seasonality and forecast.
- CEO: Product demand across countries (excluding the UK) to inform expansion strategy. <br><br>

- CMO: Top 10 revenue-generating countries (excluding the UK) with quantities sold.
- CMO: Top 10 customers by revenue to identify high-value clients.<br><br>

Following viz. is obtained as a result of this project
